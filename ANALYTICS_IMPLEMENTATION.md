## 🔒 Security & Data Filtering

### Cost Center Enforcement:
All analytics queries respect the global cost center filter:
- **Individual Cost Center**: Filters by specific CC (e.g., CC501)
- **Cost Center Group**: Expands to multiple CCs
- **All**: Shows all data (when permitted)

### Filter Application:
1. **Talents**: Direct `Agent_Cost_Center__c` field
2. **Agents**: Direct `costCenter` field
3. **Deals**: Via relationship through `clients.talentClient.Agent_Cost_Center__c`
4. **Brands**: No direct filtering (shown based on related deals)

---

## 📊 Analytics Capabilities

### Query Types Supported:
1. **Entity-based queries**: "Show all clients"
2. **Relationship queries**: "Clients with Brand X"
3. **Exclusion queries**: "Agents without Category Y"
4. **Multi-condition queries**: "Clients with X AND without Y"

### Insight Types:
1. **Revenue Analysis**: Concentration, distribution, top performers
2. **Engagement Tracking**: Recency, activity status, priority lists
3. **Performance Metrics**: Agent productivity, deal velocity
4. **Relationship Patterns**: Co-occurrence, cross-sell opportunities
5. **Risk Assessment**: Concentration risk, dormant clients

### Visualization Types:
1. **Statistics Cards**: KPIs, metrics, counts
2. **Bar Charts**: Category distribution, performance comparison
3. **Network Graphs**: Relationship visualization
4. **Lists & Tables**: Ranked data, detailed breakdowns
5. **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges, progress bars
